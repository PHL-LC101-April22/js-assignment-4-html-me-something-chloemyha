          <h2>Banh Xeo</h2>
          <p>
            In the Southern region, the “banh xeo” is the size of a large dish
            and yellow in color due to the employment of turmeric powder. The
            Southern people always add coconut milk to the rice flour to make
            the crepe extra delicious. The crepe is stuffed with bean sprouts,
            mung beans, shrimp and pork. A sweet and sour fish sauce and fresh
            vegetables are used as accompaniments.

          <h2>Banh Bot Loc</h2>
          <p>
            Banh Bot Loc is a small, chewy, translucent pork and shrimp
            dumpling, generally eaten as a snack in Vietnam. The
            pork-and-shrimp-filled dumpling is wrapped in a small piece of
            banana leaf, steamed in large batches and served with a side of
            sweet chili dipping sauce. This Vietnamese snack food originated
            from Central Vietnam in the city of Hue, where it was served as a
            snack to the emperors, hence the tedious yet beautiful packaging of
            the dumpling in banana leaf (Banh Bot Loc Goi La Chuoi).
